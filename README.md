The analysis covers ride success rates, cancellations, customer and driver ratings, payment methods, and vehicle type performance.

# Objectives
1. Extract meaningful insights from Uber ride data using SQL queries.
2. Visualize key ride trends and customer behavior through interactive Power BI dashboards.
3. Identify patterns in ride cancellations, driver performance, and payment preferences.
4. Provide actionable insights to improve ride efficiency and customer satisfaction.

# SQL Questions (KPI's):
1. Retrieve all successful bookings.
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type.
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.
4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides.
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues.
6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.
